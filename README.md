# Awareness

A tool to quickly modify and practice builds for the game Crypt of the NecroDancer (Amplified DLC)

### Prerequisites

This tool requires that you have the game Crypt of the NecroDancer and the 'Amplified' DLC installed

### Installing

Make a folder called 'Awareness' in the NecroDancer mods folder (example hierarchy shown below), then put the Awareness.exe in it along with a copy of necrodancer.xml from the data folder.

```
e.g.
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Crypt of the NecroDancer\mods\Awareness\    <-- Awareness.exe, necrodancer.xml
```

### Usage

Custom builds:
After following the installation instructions, open Awareness.exe and launch the game. You can use the Awareness program to make a build by clicking on an item slot and picking the item you want to use in your build. You may also choose a completely random build by clicking the shrine of chance in the corner. Once you are happy with your build, go back to NecroDancer, pause the game and select mods > play a mod > AWARENESS
Your build will load up! If you make a change to the desired build in the Awareness program, you will need to reload the mod to see the changes.

Seeded build mode: (for some meme racing fun!)
The stairs button in the bottom-left will open the seed entry text box. You may type up to 10 digits in this box and your build will automatically update to suit the seed. In this mode the glass shovel, glass jaw and ring of becoming will not be available. While active, all of your slots except the item and weapon slot are cursed. Ideally you would not pickup a different weapon in a race setting, but I can't curse it thanks to NecroDancer lute memes... Click the stairs again to exit this mode and un-curse your slots.

### Known issues with NecroDancer.xml

- If you start with Boots of Pain and Crown of Thorns/Ring of Pain - then you MUST also start with a potion!! Otherwise you die in the lobby RIP
- Starting with items that have a quantity often get reduced to one - such as cookies and heavy glass - not sure of a way around this one...
