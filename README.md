# Awareness

A tool to quickly modify and practice builds for the game Crypt of the NecroDancer (Amplified DLC)

### Prerequisites

This tool requires that you have the game Crypt of the NecroDancer and the 'Amplified' DLC installed

### Installing

Make a folder called 'Awareness' in the NecroDancer mods folder (example hierarchy shown below), then put the Awareness.exe in it along with a copy of necrodancer.xml from the data folder.

```
e.g.
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Crypt of the NecroDancer\mods\Awareness\    <-- Awareness.exe, necrodancer.xml
```

### Usage

Open Awareness.exe and launch the game. You can use the Awareness program to make a build by clicking on an item slot and picking the item you want to use in your build. You may also choose a completely random build by clicking the shrine of chance in the corner. Once you are happy with your build, pause the game and select mods > play a mod > awareness
Your build will load up! If you make a change to the desired build in the awareness program, you will need to reload the mod to see the changes.
(shoutouts to sillypears for the random build idea)
